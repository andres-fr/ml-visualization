# TensorBoard Mechanics

TensorBoard (TB) is a suite of [machine-learning related visualization tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch/master/screenshots/Demo.gif) designed to run on a HTTP server, so they can be then visited by a web browser locally and remotely. It is delivered as a part of the TensorFlow (TF) libraries, and the [TF tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/summary) provide an explanation for the TF-specific usage, but it can be used with other platforms like PyTorch  (PT) or simply from Python as explained in [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37902705/how-to-manually-create-a-tf-summary) and described later (Actually, it can be run from other languages like [Ruby](https://github.com/somaticio/tensorflow.rb) as well but only Python will be covered here).

As for September 2017, TensorBoard provides built-in visualization support for **scalar functions, images, histograms, text, audio and distributions**, as well as for **projector and profiling data**. For the TF and PT platforms, it also provides an inspection tool for the **computational graph**. also, via its [recently released api](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard-plugin-example), it is possible to develope **plugins** to provide support for custom visualizations and ui. this is also covered here.


### logdir and summaries

once started, the tb server inspects periodically a **log directory** (logdir) that holds the data generated by the python code. if new information is found, the visualizations are updated. the logdir has to be specified when starting the tb server as follows: `tensorboard --logdir=<log_directory>`. the ip and port can also be specified (the default value is `0.0.0.0:6006`).

this logdir contains a set of [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) (protobufs), which are basically extensible strings that contain data like functions, images, audio files, as well as the metadata attached to them like date and title. especially important is the `tag` field, which is a string that is uniquely associated with a certain “stream” of related data, and that the tb server uses to collapse the visualizations into *tag* groups.

as described in [tf tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/summary), the `tf.summary.filewriter` python class manages the output to the protobufs, and the writing operations are performed by functions like `tf.summary.tensor_summary`, `tf.summary.scalar`, `tf.summary.histogram`, `tf.summary.audio` or `tf.summary.image`, depending on the desired visualization.

the contents of the writing operation are represented in tensorflow by objects of the [`tf.summary`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary) class, which can accept numpy arrays or other types of python's numerical collections or strings as their construction arguments. when passed to the writer together with a tag, they get conveniently translated to the corresponding protobuf.

this allows us to define a logger class that encapsulates all this functionality, as explained in the next subsection.


### the logger class

The goal of this repo's [`Logger`](code/logger.py) class is to provide a clean and flexible interface between any python program and the tb server. For that, there are several existing projects:

* [tensorboard-logger](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger): it doesn't require to import TF at all, but works only for scalars
* [pytorch-tutorial](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/04-utils/tensorboard): it allows logging of scalars, images and histograms only. It is specific for PT
* [tensorboard-pytorch](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch) includes support for TB's newest functionality, except of plugins. It is also PT-specific

Our class should be able to consume numpy and python native datatypes (that is, not being PT-specific). Also it should include all of TB's functionality, including the recently released plugin API. For that, it should use the functionality described above, so it requires TF to be installed in the system.



### TB Pluging API

Front-end: groups the entries in "runs"



### SSH TUnneling

In some cases, the computer holding the log files is only accessible via SSH and prevents visiting the TensorBoard HTTP server. In that case, SSH tunneling can be performed: The following command forwards TensorBoard to `localhost:16006`, assuming it was started with the default IP address:
`ssh -p <PORT> <USER>@<SERVER> -N -f -L localhost:16006:localhost:6006`

## TODO
* fork the lanpa tb project, and adapt it for native structures.
* if it works well, expand it for the [greeter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard-plugin-example) plugin. then for the [beholder](https://github.com/chrisranderson/beholder) plugin.
* finally expand functionality with further plugins (3D t-sne, videos, TB SNAPSHOT)
* document, make tutorial
